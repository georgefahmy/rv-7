        "text": "Hello! My name is George Fahmy and I'm building a Van's Aircraft RV-7 \u00a0and I'll be documenting my build on this website! Its going to definitely be a big project, but I think I should be able to handle it.\u00a0\n\nMy callsign N890GF is a combination of my birth month/year/initials. I spent a long time debating what I wanted as my callsign, and after repeating this out loud over and over again, it just rolls of the tongue and thats when I reserved it with the FAA!\n\nEver since I was a young boy I knew I was going to be an engineer, I was drawn to taking things apart and putting them back together. I started flying remote control planes early on in life and when I got to college I began studying Aerospace Engineering. I also continued flying remote control planes and they kept getting bigger and bigger. When I graduated college and got my first job, I decided to pursue my pilots license and on March 16th 2016 I passed my checkride and became a Private Pilot! My dream of flying has become a reality, now I am trying to fulfill the other half of that dream which is to fly a plane I built myself.\u00a0\n\nI can't wait to get to that point, but until then I'm glad to share my progress and this experience with everyone!\u00a0\n\n-George",

But today I put those tools to good use and finished the Vans RV training Toolkit.\n\nIt's a small toolbox that demonstrates some of the building techniques used in building their planes. It took me about 3 hours to knock it out, I had to take my time with the first few rivets, but once I got the hang of it it went pretty quick.\n\nUsing the pneumatic squeezer really helped. I got consistent and straight rivets, both flush and the button head rivets.\n\nEven though it's just a toolbox, it's still the first step in building my plane, and I think it was a nice preview into how much work this will really be. I look forward to every minute of it!\n\nPretty soon there will be a plane in here! (Hopefully)\n\nNext time I post I will be doing the more difficult practice kit for the control surfaces.

I spent a good hour reading the first section for the emp and going over the drawings to become more familiar with them.\n\nI then began the rear spar assembly, after rounding the rear spar reinforcing bars and finishing the edges I clecoed the two spar halves to the bars and then match drilled the holes to #30.\n\nOnce the holes were drilled out, I match drilled the rear spar hinge brackets to the spar also to #30. The powder coating really makes the holes small for the clecos.\n\n\u00a0Then I match drilled the center bearing mounts to the center bearing and match drilled it to the rear spar.

The missing rivets will be riveted to the ribs when closing up the stab.\n\nHere's a close up of the shop heads, they were perfectly measured to be 0.1875\" using calipers. That makes them exactly 1.5x the original rivet diameter.\n\nI also began riveting the front spar assembly to the ribs, but it was too late to get out the rivet gun for the lower ribs. The angle on the nose rib flange is too tight to get the squeezer in and I didn't want to bend it. I'll have to do the rest of that in the morning.",

After spending the last couple days organizing and rearranging the shop with the wings and fuselage, I finally got around to finishing off the last few things on the elevator (minus the fiberglass).\u00a0\n\nI rolled the last segment of the leading edge and inserted the eye bolt hinges and set the jam nuts. I then spent some time adjusting the trim servo and trim tab.\u00a0\n\nI don't \u00a0plan on using the trim tab indicator and switch from Ray Allen, but for alignment it was great. These wires will be routed up through the fuselage and then attached to the trim switch on my control stick.\u00a0\n\n[wpvideo TO6HbiJx]",

Because I didn't rivet the brackets, I was able to perform the bracket service bulletin.\n\nIt involved riveted two doubler plates to the backside of the spar behind the aileron bracket. Here you can see the row of rivets holding those doublers in place.\n\nI then proceeded to install the aileron gap faring.\n\nOf course I edge finished, deburred, and primed the surface prior to riveting. Once that was installed I spent some time installing the aileron and determining the correct washer count and making sure I can get access to everything.\n\nI then installed the aileron with the alignment bracket on the bell-crank to align the flap and check the gap between the two.\n\nI also installed a PVC conduit for wingtip lighting. I fabricated some small L brackets to attach some adel clamps to hold the conduit. Once I finalize those I will be ready to mount the conduit and the wing will essentially be done! (Obviously the skin remains, but there's no rush to install that until much later.)",

I started out by attaching the flap braces to the wings, I match drilled and deburred the edges and holes then blind riveted them to the rear spars.\u00a0\n\nThese will get riveted to the bottom skin wth the flap hinge. Another difference between the slow build and quick build wings is that the flap brace gets blind rivets instead of solid rivets ( it's hard to get a bucking bar inside a closed up wing).\u00a0\n\nNext I got out the aileron attachment subkit and prepped and bolted the aileron attachment brackets to the aileron. I couldn't help myself but to attach it to the wing.\u00a0\n\nIt's cool to see some more control surfaces going onto the plane. I haven't torqued anything fully because I will remove this several times during the fitting and alignment.\u00a0\n\nThe aileron adds a nice amount of wing area, once I get some free time I'm going to pull out my old Aerospace Engineering books and see what kind of wing this is from a mathematical stand point. Very exciting to get more pieces together!",

I then drilled #40 pilot holes in the horns and then stepped them up to 1/4 for the AN4 bolt.\u00a0\n\nHere you can se the bolt at the base of the elevator horns. Once this was drilled the elevators swung freely with no binding in either direction. It was a smooth as butter!\u00a0\n\nI also took this time to cut the horn notches in the aft spar, this will get cleaned up and then reprimed. I also fit the fiberglass tips just to see what it looked like, I'm holding off on the fiberglass work until later.\u00a0\n\nThe tail feathers look so good! Can't wait to fit this up to the fuse in the future! You can see the trim tab on the left elevator (the whole thing is upside down) it still needs to be slightly adjusted for the trim tab push rod from the servo, but other than little things here and there, the empennage is done!",

Fortunately it also included a bunch of stuff from the garage, so now I have nearly half the garage now cleaned. More room means easier to move around the fuse and wings.\u00a0\n\nA few days ago I had my friend help me out by welding the aileron pushrods. The manual calls for two aluminum rivets that hold the threaded steel bung to the steel tube. I didn't like the way it would have been held together and the aluminum holding the steel together doesn't bode well in my mind. The welding my buddy did is much much stronger and also looks cleaner than the rivets would have.\u00a0\n\nTonight I decided to rig up the ailerons, so I lined them up with the tooling holes in the end rib, and using the aileron bellcrank jig to line up the pushrods, I adjusted the lengths of the pushrods until everything fit perfectly. I disassembled them and set everything aside for now, I need to prime the pushrods again because the powdercoating had to be removed for welding.\u00a0\n\nI also received an order from Aircraft Spruce with some shielded wires and some snap bushings. I finished rigging up the pitot tube plumbing in the wing as well as the wiring for the wingtip lighting. I'm planning on going with full nav/strobe and landing lights in the wing tips with another strobe on the tail. But that's for much later in the build.",

I began by aligning the aileron using the bellcrank jig, and slotting a few bolts in the tooling holes in the main outboard rib.\u00a0\n\nHere's the jig installed along with the lower outboard skin clecoed to the wing. With this installed I was able to then align the flap to the aileron trailing edge.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see the flap hinge clecoed to the wing, the mark on the lower right side is a 1/4\" mark along the whole hinge. In order to align the trailing edge of the aileron with the flap I had to raise the hinge and flap about 1/16 of an inch, after it was drilled it's perfectly aligned with the aileron.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see the flap hinge on the left clecoed to the wing, and the flap above. Everything will get final alignment before riveting, and then again when attaching the wings to the fuselage.\u00a0\n\nWhile I had the lower outboard skin clecoed on for the flap installation I decided to match drill the skin to the ribs and spars. There's a lot of rivets for this one skin. Now all that's left for this wing is to dimple this skin and the under-structure, but before I can rivet this I need to route a wire conduit for the wingtip lighting. It's a bundle of 4 shielded wires wth 10 or so wires inside.\u00a0\n\nNext up is the right wing.",

It's perfectly aligned from the inboard to the outboard section of the flap.\u00a0\n\nI also rigged up The pitot tube mount. I fabricated a bracket that's clecoed to the rib. I decided to mount the pitot tube just outboard of the outboard access hatch. Some builders find this could interfere with the tiedown location (the small hole just above the square cutout). As long as I don't get careless with tieing down the plane it shouldn't be an issue.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see the bracket clecoed to the rib and Lito mount bracket. Here the pitot tube was installed temporarily.\u00a0\n\nThe pitot tube mount can be removed from the plane with 4 screws that will install in dimples on the skin. This is incredibly strong as it is, but once I rivet the skin on it will be rock solid.\u00a0\n\nI also drilled and tapped the pitot tube for #6 screws to mount it flush with pitot tube mast.",

Currently there are no rivets that go through the wing skin into this plate except the ones that go through the spar. I may add more but the mounting screws hold the pitot mast and the whole installing is extremely rigid.\u00a0\n\nEven with the setup clecoed, the pitot tube is extremely rigid. I've flown many Skyhawks that have more movement in the pitot tubes by a factor of 10!\u00a0\n\nI also closed up the stall warning access plate (the hole behind the pitot tube)\u00a0\n\nThe doubler plate is installed behind and held in by the clecoes, the cover plate is installed with screws into plate nuts that have been riveted to the doubler. The doubler has been match drilled, dimpled, deburred, and primed and can be installed at any time.\u00a0\n\nThe Dynon pitot tube has angle of attack along with airspeed, which will indicate stall visually (on the EFIS) and audibly via my headset.\u00a0\n\nThe wings are getting close to complete (or at least the majority of the work) and I will soon begin the work on the fuselage!",

When I got to the final main bolt holding the tank on, I realized it was stripped! I spent nearly 30 minutes trying to get the bolt out.\u00a0\n\nI finally got the tank off and onto the bench. I spent some time checking all the seams and proseal used. The quality of the QB tanks is really good. I then worked on getting the access panel fitted. I also did a preliminary check of my leak test setup.\u00a0\n\nIt consists of some plastic tubing attached to the vent line. I have it taped to the lower edge of the tank. Once I seal the access panel I can then pressurize the tank to the recommended 1 psi, and check for leaks. If it holds pressure then I will be very\u00a0happy!\n\nI am going to take the second tank off before I do any more work on this one. I feel better doing both in parallel instead of sequentially.\u00a0\n\nLooking into the tank through the access panel. The fuel level sensor will be located in this bay of the tank.",

        "text": "Happy thanksgiving to my US friends! Today being a day off for us, I spent a few hours this morning in the garage.\u00a0\n\nI started by prepping and riveting the flap hinge on the remaining wing, the flaps are officially on! (Temporarily)\n\nI then spent some time safety wiring my autopilot servo, it was a bit tricky and I had to redo it a few times. But I eventually got it!\u00a0\n\nIt's not perfect, but it works. The wire will prevent any of the three bolts from backing out.\u00a0\n\nThe end of it (top left in the image) will be out through a small hole im going to drill through the bracket. This will secure the final bolt.\u00a0\n\nI then spent some time removing the remaining fuel tank in preparation for sealing the access panel. I really hope I don't have to continuously remove and install it. It's very tedious work.\u00a0\n\nYou can see on the left tank (right side) I have the pressure testing manometer hooked up. Once I seal the access panel to the tank, I will pressurize the tank up to 1psi or so and monitor the pressure to see if it's leaking. This can be the most nerve racking part because if there's a leak, it could be tough to find. Fingers crossed!\u00a0\n\nUntil next time, Happy Thanksgiving!",

        "text": "I finished sealing the tanks about a week ago, and the last two days I spent leak testing them. I made a water manometer and pressurized the tank to about 20\" of water. Over the course of 4 hours the tank pressure fluctuated a little, as the temperature rose in the garage the pressure went up slightly. I didn't bother doing the math to calculate the pressure rise, but it's safe to say if there was a leak it wouldn't go up. Just to be safe I also sprayed the whole tank with soapy water to see if bubbles formed. This actually cooled the tank down a bit as the cold water was sprayed on, and the pressure dropped down.\u00a0\n\nThis is the setup I did for both tanks. And both are rock solid. A big milestone under my belt and I'm glad it's over! I performed a similar test for the other tank and let it sit overnight. Again no drop in pressure and no bubbles formed at any point on the tank.\u00a0\n\nI then spent some time installing the tanks onto the wings, once they are installed there's only a couple more things to do to mark the wings done.\u00a0\n\nInstall right aileron and brackets.\u00a0\n\nInstall wiring conduit in right wing\n\nDebur and install bottom skins\n\nWing tips\n\n3 and 4 will be pushed off until the very end of the build. There's no rush in installing the bottom skins as it's better to have access than to not. 1 and 2 should be a few hours work and then I'm done! Wings will be put into storage and then fuselage time.",

I surface prepped and primed the gap faring, and match drilled and dimpled the holes as necessary. I also took this opportunity to install the aileron brackets with the service bulliten Vans posted a few months back. I already did this to the left wing.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see the back and front of the aileron bracket, with the reinforcement plates on the front of the rear spar (img 1). Rivets had to be shot and bucked because my rivet squeezer doesn't reach some of the rivets.\u00a0\n\nI also installed the outside bracket which was relatively straightforward. Again here's the outside and inside of the rivets holding the bracket on.\u00a0\n\nFinally I riveted the gap faring in place.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see it clecoed in position. I then installed rivets and was able to reach all of them with the squeezer.\n\nHere's all the button head rivets holding the faring to the rear spar.\u00a0\n\nHere's the inside of the spar. Again rivets were checked and squeezed for consistency when setting them, which is the best thing about the squeezer.\u00a0\n\nAlso thought I'd share a general update and include a short walkthrough of the shop.\u00a0\n\n\u200b[wpvideo 9hi6M0Uk]\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200b",

Plan is to store the wings in the other garage to have nearly the whole garage to work on the fuse.

Rotating it to the orientation I need will be extremely valuable.\u00a0\n\nI followed this by drilling and fitting the flap weldment and bearing blocks.\u00a0\n\nThe bearing blocks were tougher to drill than I had expected but it all fits and motion is smooth.\u00a0\n\nI then installed the two static ports on either side of the fuse, they are just two pop rivets drilled out. They will be glued in place and plumbed along with the pitot tube plumbing.\u00a0\n\nToday I decided to finish up the second seatback. I began by utilizing my new bandsaw to cut he angle stock to size. It had already paid for itself in time savings and no headaches.\u00a0\n\nCutting the notches took me more than an hour last time (using the wrong tool sucks) as well as making nice even angles. I then used my scotchbrite wheel to buff and smooth everything out.\u00a0\n\nFor the FAA as proof I'm the one building! :) and after about 3 hours I have my pilots seat!\u00a0\n\nAfter this photo was taken I drilled all the holes to #30 and then disassembled everything in prep for priming and riveting.

Being a quick build fuselage, all of this work has to be done somewhat out of order.\u00a0\n\nHere's the weldment aligned and drilled to match the bulkhead. These were measured and originally drilled to #30 so that I could hold it in place with clecos.\u00a0\n\nHere's the mount sandwiched between the two bulkheads. This is looking in from the top of the tail cone. It's a bit hard to see but there's a very small gap between the weldment and the aft most bulkhead. I'll fabricate a wedge out of some scrap aluminum and it will fill the gap.\u00a0\n\nI then fabricated the rudder stops. They are made from .125\" thick aluminum angle stock. I then match drilled and clecoed them on to verify alignment. They might need some slight adjustment once I fit the vertical stab and rudder.\u00a0\n\nAfter measuring and aligning multiple times, I enlarged the initial holes to final size for the AN4 bolt. The steel is substantially more difficult to drill through than the aluminum. I also drilled a hole in the bottom of the fuse skin to allow access for a socket wrench to reach the bolt that will bolt the tail wheel spring in the mount (that's the hole in the weldment). Next up is to remove the weldment, surface prep and the prime it and install it permanently.",

        "text": "This weekend I got in a few hours of work and finished off the tailcone. It was quite a lot of work aligning and measuring the tail wheel mount. It needs to be aligned perfectly so that when I drill vertical stab to the assembly, I meet all the edge distance requirements.\u00a0\n\nHere's the weldment after it was primed and installed. The alignment is perfect, measuring 5 times and drilling once really does pay off.\u00a0\n\nHere is the aft bulkhead riveted on with the rudder stops. I actually had a lot of fun fabricating those parts.\n\nI then decided my next project will be the rollbar.\u00a0\n\nI spent a solid hour cleaning up the shop and putting tools away and vacuuming all the aluminum scrap. I tend to be a bit lazy when it comes to putting my tools away, so I have to do big cleanups every once in a while.\u00a0\n\nI started by getting the aluminum channels out and clamped them to the table. It will take some adjusting to get the alignment right, but so far measurements have come out perfect.\u00a0\n\nI then fabricated the two plates that will join the channels together. Along with all the L brackets that needed to be made. I can't say it enough...but my bandsaw is the greatest tool I've purchased!\u00a0\n\nHere's the full sized drawing to give a perspective of what I'm working on. And a completed L bracket in the top left corner.\u00a0\n\nDrilled the holes to #30 per the drawing, but they will be opened up to 1/4\" for the bolts when it's mounted to the fuselage.\u00a0\n\nHopefully I get some time this week to work a bit more, but I'll play it by ear.",

        "text": "Tonight I spent about 3 hours working on the rollbar. It's a very tedious job and requires a lot of precision.\u00a0\n\nI began by placeing the plate I made last week onto the two rear channels. After measuring and checking the width of the rollbar I drilled the plate to the channels and clecoed it in place. I then placed the lower strip into the channel. I measured the rivet holes and used my center punch to mark the points. The holes are 1.5\" apart and 1/4\" away from the edge of the channel.\u00a0\n\nThis is the first half of the lower strip drilled and clecoed. It doesn't look like much, but this alone took me about 45 minutes.\u00a0\n\nWhere's the inside of the strip.\u00a0\n\nI managed to finish both sides of the strip and everything measured up perfectly! I then proceeded to do the top strip. It's the same process. I then took out the other half of the rollbar and placed that on the strips and clamped them in place. I'm using blocks of wood to keep it off the table, but I'm not happy with the potential for it to twist. I'm going to figure out a better way to do it.\u00a0\n\nTomorrow I'm hoping to finish up the rollbar!",

        "text": "Today I spent a few hours prepping the aft seat pans for riveting. I wanted to install the two remaining antennas on the underside of the fuse. This includes the transponder and ADSB antennas. Both are blade style antennas.\u00a0\n\nI used the provided templates to ensure alignment. And I centered the antenna between the two seat ribs in each case. I then installed the two antennas and torqued the nuts.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see the two antennas mounted. I will install the BNC connectors once I know where the wires will route.\u00a0\n\nNow that the antennas were installed I began final prep for riveting the seat floors. I began by vacuuming out all the debris from the drilling and then clecoed the seat in.\u00a0\n\nI then used LP3-4 pop rivets to rivet the seat floor in. I also installed the crotch strap brackets which can be seen at the bottom of the picture.\u00a0\n\nHere is the picture during the drilling. I used two 1/8th\" drill bits to ensure the spacing was correct. I drilled the brackets to the ribs and then disassembled and deburred, primed, and then riveted the assembly in.\u00a0\n\nI took a break from riveting and wired up the pitch autopilot servo. I then ran the wiring harness through the conduit under the seats and stored the wire there for now. I also ran the wire to the tail for the rear position/strobe light, and the elevator trim servo. Once I install the elevator it will be a quick hook up to the servo and a few wires for the tail light and the wiring will be done in the aft fuse.\u00a0\n\nHere's the autopilot servo wire bundled. Also the two white wires are routed inboard and forward to the forward fuse in front of the spar. These will route up to the panel.\u00a0\n\nTomorrow I'll put in the copilot's seat floor and then begin work on the center tunnel between the two seats.",

It's an awkward part to rivet in, but I eventually got it.\u00a0\n\nHere you can see it riveted between the seat ribs just to the right of the copilot's stick attachment (Stick is removed for now). Once I match drilled it to the ribs I removed it, deburred, primed, and then riveted the nutplates, then riveted the two pieces into the fuselage.\u00a0\n\nOnce I got the crotch strap in stalled I then vaccumed and cleaned out the underside of the seat pan. I then installed it with the LP-4 pop rivets.\u00a0\n\nI also installed the flap motor assembly and one of the side covers.\u00a0\n\nHere is the flap motor attached temporarily with the AN4-10A bolt to the flap actuator weldment (white). I also have the flap position sensor that will attach to the weldment to relay the position of the flaps to the flight computer.\u00a0\n\nThe cabin area is nearing completion, next up is to install the rollbar to the cross brace and fit the top skin to prep it for match drilling.",

My goal was to get the rollbar, and final top skin fitted.\u00a0\n\nI started by finishing the riveting on the canopy frame and mounting brackets.\u00a0\n\nHere are the very messy rivets that hold the angle to the bulkhead. I don't have any tools that could get to these rivets cleanly, but I got it done.\u00a0\n\nI then measured and aligned the rollbar brackets and drilled them to the frame. This is the left side. I then bolted this to the structure.\u00a0\n\nThe right side was much easier for some reason.\u00a0\n\nOnce I bolted these to the frame, I mounted the rollbar.\u00a0\n\nI clamped the rollbar to the now bolted on brackets. I also fitted the channel to the baggage bulkhead and to the rollbar.\u00a0\n\nI then filed down the brackets to match the contour of the skin. This is to allow the final skin to bolt to the rollbar without any bends.\u00a0\n\nOnce I finished filing the brackets I got out the fuse skin and laid it out, I then clecoed it to the fuselage to prep for match drilling.\u00a0\n\nHere's the final skin clecoed to the fuse. The rear window will nestle under he skin and on top of the rollbar. This skin will get riveted later on after I finish mounting more components behind the baggage wall. Still need to install the transponder and the ELT.",

This is countersunk and riveted to the channel.\u00a0\n\nThe remaining 8 holes will be riveted along with the final fuselage skin, the baggage bulkhead, and the gusset plate. All in all, there will be 5 layers of metal sandwiched.\u00a0\n\nI also spent the time to finish drilling and bolting the rollbar to the mounting brackets and attached the assembly to the fuselage.

Once off I could easily screw the fitting in.\u00a0\n\nThis is the fitting installed and with tape over it to keep moisture out. You can see how tight it is to get a wrench on there.\u00a0\n\nThe other oil fitting is much easier.\u00a0\n\nThe fitting (with tape over it) is right above the left p-mag and just under the oil breather tube (with the red cap).\u00a0\n\nI also installed the fuel pump outlet and fitting for the fuel pressure.\u00a0\n\nFuel will come out the bottom port and go to the fuel servo near the front of the engine.\u00a0\n\nI also installed the oil pressure fitting\n\nAnd the manifold pressure fitting from the number 3 cylinder.\u00a0\n\nYou can see it here wrapped in tape just above the oil return line.\u00a0\n\nI finally installed the fuel overflow fitting to the fuel pump.\u00a0\n\nThere are a few more things to install, but that can be done after the engine is hung.

It was more difficult than I thought, but everything lined up great once I figured out the technique.\u00a0\n\nFirst a huge thank you to my uncle for helping me out, definitely needed his strength and even one of his tools.\n\nWe began by repositioning the plane into the shade, and I propped the tail up on one of my saw horses to bring the nose down a bit.\u00a0\n\nWe then hoisted the engine and rolled it to the plane.\u00a0\n\nIt was a bit nerve wracking, but the hoist was pretty stable. \u00a0\n\nThe alignment process was quite tricky, and getting even one of the bolts to align took some wiggling and repositioning.\u00a0\n\nWith a dynafocal type 1 Mount, the bolts converge on the CG of the engine when tightened. This made it difficult to align everything initially until we tightened everything down.\u00a0\n\nRemoving the hoist and letting it hang was one of the coolest things ever!\u00a0\n\nI got everything back into the garage and will begin installing some of the engine instrumentation and continue moving forward!",

I'm using a strap to tighten everything down. \n\nOnce I got everything lined up, I tightened the strap and some clamps to get the skins to line up. \n\nHere you can see the clamps holding the frame down, and the alignment of the skins. I have a uniform gap all along the skins. I also ensured that my hinge spacers have enough clearance from the hinges. \n\nHere you can see the spacing between the spacer and the hinge. I've read that this has caused problems for people, so I made my spacer 1/8th of an inch narrower.\n\nI then lined everything up and drilled the splice plate for the frame. \n\nInitially drilled to #40, this allows for some adjustments if necessary. I also drilled the hinge joints to #30, where the hinge meets the cross rib.\n\nAfter everything was drilled I removed the canopy frame and the skin and prepped everything, primed required surfaces, and riveted the frame together.\n\nI didn't get any pictures of it, but i drilled the canopy hinge holes to 1/4\" and then enlarged them to 3/8th for the bushings. I then fit the frame to the fuselage and immediately had interference from the canopy seal supports. \n\nThis picture shows the gap between the frame (on the left) and the seal (wavy on the right) with the blue film in the gap. This is a nice gap, however when rotating the frame up the center portion of the frame hits the center seal. I will file it down until it swings freely.",

A few back and forth emails and I was out in the garage measuring hose runs.\n\nI put together a list of lengths and applications, packed up a box of my existing hoses that came with the engine, and shipped them to Tom.\n\nTom let me know he received my package and almost immediately he turned it around and shipped me my finished hoses. It was incredible service. I opened up the box yesterday, and in about 10 minutes, all the hoses on the plane were installed, everything lined up perfectly. It was one of the easiest things I've done thus far on the project. I will also say, the price for the hoses and service is incredibly reasonable and worth every penny. I highly recommend them!",

        "text": "The goal for the weekend was to install the Vans ELT mount and the ELT in the plane. It's mounted on the right side behind the baggage bulkhead. The Vans mount has you use blind rivets to attach the bracket on the stringers than run along the side of the fuselage. It's extremely difficult to get the rivet squeezer into the right position to drive the rivets properly, but I managed. I also decided to install the ADS-B module on the same bracket because there was plenty of room. \n\nOnce I had everything in position I ran the wires through the conduit. This includes the harness for the ADS-B, the phone line for the ELT, the 3-conductor wire for the ELT power and gps, and the rg-400 coax cable for the ADS-B antenna. I somehow managed to fit everything through the two conduits I have running under the seats. Only thing left to do is attach the antenna to the ELT and the ADS-B. By closing those two units out, the tail is now completely wired! Everything else will be forward of the seats and under the panel.",

This allows the ELT to transmit GPS location. \n\nI soldered the shielded 3 conductor wire to the connector, insulated it with some silicone, then soldered the short 4th wire, which is connected to a small LED to test the gps signal. Once that's verified as working, that short wire gets cut and insulated against cable coming from the connector.\n\nI also measured and cut the coax cable for the ADS-B antenna. It's routed through the center rib near the pitot tubing. \n\nHere you can see the elevator bell crank in its forward most position. Plenty of clearance to everything routed there, and considering the way I have things secured there is no relative motion between the antenna, pitot/AOA tubes, and the surrounding structure.  I then crimped the BNC connector on the other end and connected it to the module. \n\nI then spent some time experimenting with the Engine Module location and sensor harnesses. Once I install the rudder pedals I can rivet the panel sub structure and begin systems installation. It will be temporary, just to make the wire harness, then things will be removed for the interior painting that I will do.\n\nI also confirmed and placed the order for my interior. I am going with Classic Aero Designs in Oregon. They have some really nice options and custom colors.\n\nI am going with an all leather interior, with their Aviator seats, with the headrest option. The seats also have my N number embroidered and an RV-7 logo. I am very pleased with the service and support that I got from Classic Aero. A few back and forth emails and one phone call, and everything was figured out and the order placed. I am very excited about this!",

Now the snorkel can fit without and modification.\n\nI then took my time installing the prop. The mounting bolts can only turn a couple turns at a time before having to wiggle the prop and tighten another one. \n\nOnce I got them all tighten I torqued it by hand for now, but MT calls for 65ft-lbs if torque on the bolts and then safety wiring them in pairs. I will do that later just in case (I really really hope not) I have to take the prop off again.\n\nIt's just so cool to look at. \n\nI just had to test fit the top cowl, it's still high by about 3/4 of an inch, it's sitting on the baffles, which I have yet to modify.

It's a nice T hangar that's north facing (shaded all day), and has plenty of room for the project. I'll be migrating there over the next couple weeks.\n\nBefore making the big move, there's still a couple things that I want to finish up in the garage. The first thing was that when I installed the canopy release mechanism, I realized that the flap housing was being pushed backwards and wouldn't install. So I modified the mounting holes, and everything lines up much nicer.\n\nThis will get installed with a couple washers and the offset of the holes won't be noticed.\n\nI also installed the elevator push rod that goes through the center tunnel, since I had everything off. It needed some coaxing but it installed just fine.\n\nThe push rod connects the control sticks to the bell crank that's right behind the baggage bulkhead.\n\nI also cut some two conductor wire to length for the flap motor power lines, and added a couple connectors so that it's removable. Once it's installed this will get a zip tie wrapped around it between the tabs and it will be fully secure.\n\nNext up is to finish the canopy frame.",

        "text": "After three and a half years in the garage. I finally moved the plane to its new home in my hangar!\n\nThere was probably a lot more work I could have done before moving it, but there were some circumstances that dictated I needed to move to the airport.\n\nIt started by first getting a giant truck with a lift gate. Once I got that to the house I had my friend Mike over to help me out. We removed the canopy and rear window (which I just had sitting on the plane temporarily...need to finish this) and then rolled the plane out into the driveway.\n\nI know it doesn't look like much, but seeing the plane in the driveway is one of the coolest things.\n\nAfter doing some measurements and planning over the last couple months, I realized that the wheels were too wide for the lift gate. Luckily Mike had a 4x8 sheet of plywood that we laid on top of the lift gate. \n\nWe rolled the plane forward and lined it up. If it wasn't for the plywood, this would have been a very precarious balancing issue (Thanks Mike!). [wpvideo 8pUR7WLc ]\n\nWe chocked the wheels once we made sure the engine wouldn't hit the floor of the truck when lifting, and then raised the plane up and pushed it into the truck. My girlfriend Britney did an awesome job holding the whole airplane in the air!\n\nOnce the plane was in. we loaded up the rest of the few remaining items and secured everything down. It felt a little nerve wracking having all this in the back of a truck, but it all went off without a hitch.\n\nI managed to drive the truck (slowly) down to the airport in San Martin and we basically did the reverse, and there were no issues. Luckily the rain held off the whole time we were moving.\n\n[wpvideo MzmIxnKv ]\n\nWe rolled the plane in and it felt like a huge accomplishment. I immediately wanted to start mounting the tail and wings and everything on the plane, but the wings will have to wait for another time.\n\nI loosely fit the horizontal and vertical stabilizers using some clamps. This is probably the coolest thing ever (so far)!\n\nAll in all, it was a very successful and satisfying day. I couldn't have done it without the help of Mike and Britney and of course my mom, who brought us all some lunch and helped with the moving of everything! (Garage can now be used for her car again)!",

She has been very encouraging and really wants to help on the project. So we got started by mounting the elevators to the horizontal stab on the bench. \n\nOnce we got the elevators lined up and clamped, we measured which horn was aft, and then removed the left elevator. \n\nI measured and then drilled the hole for the pushrod, and then I fabricated a block to span the gap between the horns, remounted the left elevator and placed the block between the horns. This ensured that the #30 pilot hole was drilled perfectly perpendicular. \n\nOnce the pilot hole was drilled, I enlarged it for the AN3 bolt that will eventually hold the pushrod.\n\nThe resulting holes are perfectly lined up and perpendicular.\n\nOnce this was done, we removed the elevators and then positioned the horizontal stab on the fuselage.\n\nWe measured, and then measured, and then measured again. I clamped everything into place and measured one last time.\n\nI then drilled my #30 pilot hole through the stab and then remeasured. After ensuring nothing moved, I final drilled it for the AN3 bolt and then inserted the bolt to prevent anything from shifting.\n\nThis is the underside of the outer holes after drilling the pilot holes. Edge distances for the longeron were right on the money.\n\nI then proceeded to drill the remaining two holes, and fabricated the F-798 shims. Everything lined up and I did one final measurement, and it all remained perfectly aligned.\n\nI bolted the forward bolts, used a 3/16th spacer to raise the rear spar to the right height, and then drilled and bolted the four holes to mount the rear spar to the fuselage.\n\nNext up is the vertical stab!",

These bolts go through 4 or 5 layers of metal, and need to be precisely placed.\n\nI got everything properly lined up and was able to keep the minimum edge distances on everything \n\nI bolted everything into place to make sure the vertical stab was still straight. I also decided to check the tail fairing, just to see how it looks. \n\nThis is really starting to look cool. The last thing I did was verify the rudder still swung freely and to measuring the rudder throw. \n\nI I staled the elevators and the rudder and everything was as smooth as silk. There was no binding of any of the control surfaces. The rudder has the required 35deg of throw, but I need to adjust the rudder stops, as the rudder exceeds the 35deg of throw before hitting the stops.",

[wpvideo 4TKvZkRZ ]\n\nI also installed my ELT antenna in the aft the airplane. It will sit under the vertical stabilizer faring. I like this much better than mounting it on top of the fuselage.\n\nThis is looking down onto the horizontal stabilizer. It will be secured under the faring with a clamp so as to not let the antenna rub on the fiberglass.\n\nI also spent some time a few weeks ago working on the canopy frame and springs. I spent a few hours fabricating the attach points. \n\nHere you can see both the canopy frame side and the fuselage side of the attachments. I originally fabricated a backing plate out of some 1/16th aluminum and two nut plates, however after some research online, I came across a CNCd version of this that is a single piece and has a back plate this is awesome. I installed those and I highly recommend them! Buller Enterprises makes a few experimental parts. I purchased the ball stud mounts and the canopy guides.  Easy to install and much stronger than the ones I made.\n\nI also finished riveting and test fitting the canopy frame stiffeners. \n\nI still need to fabricate some spacers and then prime/prep all the surfaces.

I've completed about 100 hours since I made the list a few months back, so I've updated it all to be as accurate as possible. I then took the remaining items and I've been organizing them in a JIRA project I made to track my active work. This is a product I use at work on a daily basis to manage my teams' projects, so I figured I'd try it for managing my own project.\n\nJIRA Project\n\nHere is the collapsed view of my project.

Its been great to look at pinout diagrams from my avionics suppliers and then visualize the harness pin-to-pin. It really helps me to understand the way I will make the harness.\n\nSystem Block Diagram\n\nI made a system overview block diagram to make sure I was accounting for all the items in the system. This probably doesn't have every item, but it was still great for visualizing the system.\n\nFull System Wire Harness\n\nI then used all the documentation I had for all the ECUs and components, and made the full system wiring harness. Again, I think this has everything covered, but I will continuously be checking the system before completely turning it on. I have a power supply that I will use for testing that has protection circuits in place in order to prevent any overcurrent or shortage issues.",

        "text": "Today I spent a couple hours putting the forward fuselage gussets in place. They are unique to the -7 vs the -7A. The tri-gear plane rear landing gear are mounted just forward of the center section. Since the -7 is a tail trager, there is a gap here that need to be reinforced using these gussets. They are attached to the sides of the fuselage with 5 bolts that need to be match drilled. The gussets also line up with the bottom wing attach bolts. \n\nI lined everything up and then drilled the holes to #40 and then enlarged for the AN3 bolts. I prepped and primed these and then attached them to the fuselage. The whole interior will be painted with my interior paint, but it\u2019s good to prime all the parts especially mating surfaces. \n\nI also sent a bit of time working on the panel attachment brackets. Since I\u2019m using twin Skyview HDC screens, I need to move the Vans panel supports inboard. This requires making some custom brackets to attach the panel to the sub panel. I received a shipment of L stock from vans that worked perfectly for this. \n\nI decided to wrap up the center section bolts that are used for the tricycle gear. In the tail dragged version the bolts need to be put into the center section. \n\nThe bottom bolts were difficult to reach but everything is now in place and torqued. \n\nI also placed the remaining two cover supports on the sides of the fuselage, forward of the center section. \n\nNext up is to wrap up the exhaust hangar modification. And to drill the wing fuel attachment bracket to the sides of the fuselage.",

I wanted to get some specific things done in order to make a little progress towards fitting the wings. \n\nWing fuel tank attach bracket\n\nI spent the day installing the fuel tank attach bracket to the outside of the fuselage. This required fabricating the internal support bracket and spacers. It took a little longer than I though, but got it done. \n\nAfter taking these pictures, I buffer and then primed the brackets. These are steel so they are very susceptible to corrosion. Now that these are installed. I can prep to mount and test fit the wings! \n\nAfter this I spent an hour or so finishing up the exhaust hangar modification. I didn\u2019t take any pictures, but because I\u2019m using the Vetterman 4 pipe exhaust and the heat muff, the standard Vans exhaust hanger can\u2019t be used on that side. So I fabricated a support bar that shifts the hangar mounting point outboard of the heat muff. I finished it by drilling the bolt hole for the mount and attaching it with all metal lock nuts. \n\nI also removed the bolts for the exhaust attaching it to the engine in preparation for riveting the firewall to the bottom skin where the exhaust exits the cowl. This isn\u2019t accessible when the exhaust it attached to the engine.",

I\u2019m using the Ray Allen trim system from Vans, so everything is nicely packaged together into its own subsystem. \n\nModified trim bushing block\n\nI started out by modifying the plastic block that holds the pivot arm. This needed two holes drilled through it foe the AN3 bolts that hold it to the aluminum plate. I also botched the larger counter bored hole to allow access to the cotter pin that holds the pivot arm in place. \n\nMounting plate drilled\n\nI then trimmed and match drilled the mounting plate to the seat pan holes. This allowed for a perfect fit. Once I drilled the two holes on the left, I temporarily installed it to drill the two holes on the right to the floor ribs. \n\nOriginal hole and new hole in ribs\n\nHere you can see the original hole where the nut plate was. I removed the nut plate and then used the center hole to mount the plate in order to drill the bottom hole. This was done on both sides of the center channel. \n\nCutting the pivot arm to the right length\n\nI then cut the pivot arm tube to the right length so it can sit in the block and then be mounted to the metal plate. I cut off about an inch of tube. Once I did that I drilled a 1/16th hole for the cotter pin. \n\nMounting plate completed\n\nAfter drilling the block to the mounting plate, I dimpled, and mounted the nut plates to the mounting plate. I will complete this plate by priming it before final installation. \n\nPivot arm installed into block\n\nI then installed the pivot arm into the plastic block, and then installed the washer and cotter pin to hold it all together. \n\nTest fitting the assembly\n\nI then test fit the assembly by installing the bottom two screws. The top two are where the floor is held on to the ribs. The pivot arm needed to be adjusted to not rub on the control rod.\n\nIn the bottom left is the servo block. I need to drill that to the floor rib for final installation as well. \n\nThe final thing to do next time is to finishing the assembly with the control stick springs and cleaning up the assembly with some final adjustments.",

It includes everything for engine monitoring including oil pressure, temperature, fuel flow, fuel pressure, manifold pressure, rpm, etc. It\u2019s quiet extensive. \n\nI started by reviewing my wiring diagram that I made, and reviewed the pin out of the EMS D37 connector.\n\nEMS box and connectors\n\nI then opened up the main harness that is included in the skyview EMS in order to identify every pin. \n\nTop half of the connector\n\nI used my multimeter to check each wire and then I used that to label each one according to the function. \n\nEMS temporarily installed\n\nHere\u2019s the EMS and the main harness (silver) plugged in. As you can see in this picture, the wires are labeled and then separated out into the appropriate pairings (e.g. oil pressure power, ground and signal). Then I began to wire the engine sensors and measure the wiring runs. \n\nFirewall pass-through for main harness\n\nHere you can see the main EMS harness come through for all the firewall forward components. Mounted to the top of the firewall is the sensor manifold, which includes oil pressure, fuel pressure, and manifold pressure. \n\nSensor manifold closeup\n\nHere\u2019s the oil and fuel pressure sensors mounted to the firewall. These are wired into the main harness and share their 5v source on the same pin (pin18) of the EMS. It\u2019s a common source for low power components and is shared between several other sensors. \n\nOil temperature sensor\n\nHere\u2019s a close up of the oil temp sensor wired to the harness. \n\nManifold pressure sensor\n\nHere\u2019s the manifold pressure sensor. It has a tube that\u2019s connected to a T in order to share a manifold pressure source with the ignition system. E-Mag ignitions also need to know the pressure of the intake in order to adjust timing of the spark. \n\nContinuing the work is a bit slow, but it\u2019s getting there. Lots left to do.",

All of the cables routed from the aft fuselage and under the seats funnels into the center section and routes on the floor up to the panel. \n\nOnce I organized the rats nest of wires I ended up with two nice bundles. These include the two trim motors, flap motor, ADSB, transponder, ELT, and ADHARS unit. These will be wired to the different serial and power connectors under the panel. \n\nOn the right side of the fuse I\u2019ve separated out the radio antenna wire so that I reduce interference as much as possible. This will be behind there side panel from my interior, so it won\u2019t be seen. The RG400 coax wire has a minimum bend radius of 1in, which I am well above in all these bends.\n\nOn the left side of the fuse I\u2019ve bundled my two autopilot harnesses. These are separated out from the power wires and autopilot disconnect which will route directly to the pilots stick. The Dynon autopilot harnesses are the standard SkyView Net 9 conductor harnesses except for power. So the only wires needed are the paired data wires. \n\nHere are the Dsub15 connectors for the GPS, ADSB, and Transponder. The red wire for the ADSB and Transponder are left off the connector in order to connect to the VPX. The GPS is powered by the SkyView screens, so it\u2019s fully pinned into the connector.\n\nThere are 5 components that use serial connections. In order to connect all the serial to both the PFD and MFD screens, I made a serial bus board that has 7 connections. These are all hooked up in parallel on each pin. When I connect all the connections to the board, each screen will be hooked up to each component properly. I\u2019ve done the pins so that each Rx and Tx from the screens are assigned properly.",

I originally made the harness a few years ago, and forgot to write down the wire designations. I tested the connector and verified with the specs provided with the ELT and then made the DSub15 connector for the serial bus. The ELT just has serial Rx, power and ground. \n\nHere\u2019s the DIN connector that plugs into the ELT. The tail sticking out is to test the Rx signal. It will eventually be tucked away. \n\nVPX J10 & J12\n\nHere are two of the main power connectors from the VPX. I connected these and began to separate out the bundles by where the wires needed to route. \n\nVPX J1, J2, J8\n\nOn the other side of the VPX are the two D25 connectors J1 and J2. These are for some lower power items, like flap position sensor and interior lights, as well as the VPX serial connection. The J2 connector is for all the switches. These will go directly to the panel switches, which will be connected to ground on the other side. \n\nBundled by function and aircraft location \n\nThese bundles are such that each group will go to the same general area of the plane. The lighting harness for example is split into two half way down in order to go to the left and right, for each wingtip. Others are for powering the aft components such as the ADSB, transponder, and autopilot servos. \n\nSwitch bundle and serial bundle \n\nThis side contains the switch bundle, which heads off to the right side of the image from my hand, and the other bundles are for the flap position sensor, and the serial connection. \n\nEMS and other wires\n\nHere\u2019s a wider shot showing the EMS in it\u2019s mounting location. Once the plane is built this area will only be accessible by laying under the panel and accessing it from below. \n\nThe last thing I did was to drill the copilot\u2019s control stick for the quick release pin. \n\nThis pin allows the copilots stick to be removed in case the passenger wants a more comfortable ride. There will be two wires coming out of here for the copilots PTT for the radio. It will be fitted with a connector in order to make the system removable.",

        "text": "Tonight I spent a few hours making my ignition harnesses. My engine uses twin P-Mag ignitions, so I had to make two identical harness. \n\nI started by removing the connectors on the ignitions so I can attach the wires. The connectors use a screw-clamp style connection. \n\nRight ignition\n\nHere you can see the connector attached to the ignition with the wires attached. This is a six pin connector with Ground, ignition kill, power, and RPM out. There are two additional pins that can be shorted in order to change the default timing of the ignition. \n\nLeft ignition\n\nThe left ignition connector is on the bottom of the ignition and is a bit more challenging to get to, but I managed. \n\nCompleted harnesses\n\nHere are the bundles completed. Looking forward to the day I get to start it up!",

        "text": "Today I spent a solid chunk of time routing wires. Making wiring harnesses has been one of my the more satisfying parts of the project so far. \n\nFirewall forward\n\nI started by organizing the firewall forward sensor wires. This bundle contains everything from engine temps, to oil and fuel pressure and the ignition harnesses. These are now secured to the engine mount and won\u2019t be able to move. \n\nOn the other side of the firewall I\u2019ve secured everything and routed a portion of the harness down the left side of the fuselage in order to route the wires to proper area. \n\nCenter tunnel main harness bundle\n\nThis is the center section between the pilot and passenger seats. The main harness here is routed up to the vertical power above for all the power distribution. Other parts of this include all the serial connections, and the electric pitch and roll trim motors. \n\nHere\u2019s another look at all the wires and how they\u2019re routed (Ignore the tie wraps and scraps). The harness splits to allow for the left and right lighting wires to route to the correct wing. I\u2019ve isolated all power wires from my radio wires so that there will be no interference. \n\nSerial Hub\n\nThis is my serial hub, it had ports for the primary and multifunction flight displays (empty slots) and the five serial avionics. The ADSB, transponder, Vertical Power, GPS and ELT (black box) all communicate via serial. This hub allows all the components to connect to the two main flight displays in parallel for each of the five serial ports. Once I\u2019m down with all the routing of the wires this will be mounted to the sub-panel permanently. \n\nFuel pump and selector valve\n\nOnce I finished with the wiring I wanted to test fit my fuel pump and selector valve. I have custom fuel hoses from TS Flightlines, so I had to modify the brackets to allow the hoses to fit (you can see the cut bracket on the left below the wires). Once I mount the wings, the two fuel hoses will attach to the fuel tanks.",

I wanted to get these laid out first since they are symmetrical about the centerline.\n\nHere you can see the cutouts marked for the two main EFISs and the four sub panels in the center. I have left room for an Avidyne (either 540 or 440) in the center, as well as a Garmin G5 on the left of the pilots screen. Given the additional cost of the Avidine however, I will be waiting a little while to purchase that. \n\nNext is to begin cutting the panel!",

        "text": "Today I cut the panel for the main EFIS screens and the sub modules. I measured and compared to the CAD probably a dozen times, and luckily it all came out straight and even. \n\nThe first thing I did was look up how much the blank RV-7 panel costs on vansaircraft.com -$40. With that knowledge, I began to cut the first sub module hole, the knob panel. \n\nAfter the knob panel went smoothly I began on the second one, the AP panel. All the modules are the same dimensions, but with the variability in my hand cuts I checked and lined up each element after test fitting. \n\nThe process begins by drilling a 1/8\u201d hole in the corners (1/16\u201d radius). Then using a cutoff wheel I cut just inside the lines for the hole. Then I filed the edges to the final size so that each item fit perfectly, but with no catches or tight spots. Then using some scotchbright, I smoothed the edges out so they are soft to the touch. \n\nHere are the four modules sitting in the panel. I need to buy some mk2000-6 nut plates so that I can screw these to the panel. \n\nNext I cut the large hole for the main Dynon HDX displays. It was very satisfying when the display was installed. Many years to get to this point! \n\nFinally I cut the second hole, making sure everything lined up and was square, and then test fit the second display. \n\nOne thing I was (and still am) a little concerned about, is the angled ledge on the displays. With the gap below being just less than 2\u201d, I planned to install my toggle switches centered between the display and the bottom of the panel. But with the ledge of the display sticking out a bit, I might bias the switches lower to give myself a little extra room to be comfortable flipping the switches. \n\nOnce I finalize the position of the Garmin G5 I\u2019m going to install just to the left of the pilots display, I\u2019ll start drilling the holes for the toggle switches. I placed one just below the screen in order to see how far up and down the switch is when toggled. It should have plenty of clearance from the display.",

I didn\u2019t get individual photos, but here is the back once the nut plates were riveted on. \n\nAfter double checking the alignment of everything individually I test fit all the components. \n\nI then decided to mount the primary display tray to the back of the panel. \n\nThe panel then screws into this from the front of the panel. This will allow for some additional components to be mounted easily behind the panel. \n\nI checked the fit by temporarily installing the panel in the plane. Plenty of room all around. \n\nStarting to look almost like a real plane! \n\nNext I\u2019ll begin marking and drilling the switches and some additional components including the Hobbs meter, ELT tester, the Dynon Ident button and dimmer knobs.",

I have 6 switches dedicated to the primary power and engine ignition. \n\nHere the top left is the master switch, and below is the L PMag ignition power and test switches. The PMag ignitions have a built-in generator that kicks in above 800 RPM. The test switch allows you to ensure the ignition will continue running when power is removed. \n\nI installed the remaining ignition switches, along with the Alternator enable switch next to the master switch. Then I installed the two switches below the display to ensure they are easy to use and are not inhibited by the angled part of the HDX screen. These are the Avionics and Auto Pilot switches. \n\nHere are all the remaining switches installed. There are five switches under the display for the aircraft lights. This includes landing, taxi, strobe and nav lights, along with interior lighting. The three far right switch are the fuel pump, flaps, and engine start. \n\nThe boost pump switch is right up against the flap bracket. I may not use this given the proximity to the switch. It\u2019s all removable, so we\u2019ll see. \n\nI also installed the Dynon dimmer knob, and the dedicated IDENT button. The ident function is useful to have a dedicated button for so I don\u2019t have to navigate the display menus. Similarly with the dimmer. Even though the system has light detection and auto adjusts the brightness, I like to have finer control. \n\nThe engine start button is a very high quality push button. It\u2019s extremely satisfying to press. Can\u2019t wait to fire up the engine with this!",

        "text": "This evening I received an order with my new Bose 6-pin connector cord. I decided to use the Lemo style plugs on my plane rather than the GA plugs. The ship power for the Bose A20s is just so much more convenient. \n\nI temporarily powered my Efis, radio and intercom to check all the wiring with the headphones. \n\nSuccessful transmit and receive functionality \n\nI was able to tune the AWOS to verify reception. Crystal clear. I then checked on the local traffic frequency with my handheld radio and everything functioned normally. A helicopter pilot happened to pass through and was able to verify my transmitting capabilities. The antenna is on the underside of the plane, and being inside the hangar I didn\u2019t expect good quality but it seemed work okay, no static or anything. \n\nRadio functions\n\nI\u2019ve been making a lot of progress on all the avionics wiring and power circuitry as well. I plugged my laptop into the VPX and configured it with my specific setup. I also verified the PPS with the master switch on I was detecting 12V on the Main output. \n\nUpdating the databases and software \n\nAll the major systems have been installed and individually component tested. I\u2019m now beginning to do the subsystem testing and slowly adding additional components. Once I finish manually verifying the power pins on the VPX, I\u2019ll plug all the connectors in and have the VPX supply power directly allowing me to test the switches and full circuits. \n\nChecking the radio functions\n\nI also finished installing the latch fingers on the canopy frame and verified the appropriate clearances around the fuselage and roll bar. \n\nNow that the frame is fully riveted it\u2019s time to prime and paint the interior, and then mask the frame where the canopy will go and paint the dashboard a flat black. Now that we\u2019ve gotten through some of the biggest rain storms California has seen in a while, I\u2019m hoping to get that knocked out soon.",

I hooked up my laptop to the VPX to configure and test all the switches and devices before powering things on for the first time. \n\nOnce I powered up the avionics I was able to work through all the setup and testing of the different components. \n\nToday I spent time wiring up the trim servos. They wire up to the autopilot panel so that they can be controlled using the Dynon auto trim functionality. I also wired up the flap position sensor. The flap sensor is wired to the VPX rather than to the Dynon EMS. The reason for this is so the VPX can monitor and control the deflection of the flaps to certain levels. \n\nI don\u2019t have it in the picture, but I also installed the Garmin G5 and powered and tested as well.  I also wired up a micro switch to the canopy latch, it displays a digital \u201clight\u201d on the EFIS if the canopy is open. \n\nI\u2019ve really been enjoying wiring up and testing all the avionics.

It was super easy to install using the template provided and mounts directly to the canopy frame skin that covers the panel. \n\nHere you can see the trim mounted to the top of the skin. Its about half an inch thick, is padded and finished with a nice soft leather. It\u2019s held on to the skin by 11 screws from the bottom. What\u2019s nice about it is that it hangs about .25\u201d below the skin, which is perfect for hiding the panel light, which I have held on by tape temporarily. \n\nI turned off my hangar lights and tested it out. The screens do cast a slight shadow over the switches, but it\u2019s not fully obstructed which is nice. \n\nI also received my second avionics tray from Dynon and installed that. I had to modify it slightly to allow for the removal of the radio module. \n\nNow all that\u2019s left to do is finish up the wiring cleanup, bundle all the harnesses and then it\u2019s done! I\u2019ll remove the panel and all the avionics and prep it for paint. The canopy frame is also ready for paint which is the last thing to do before bonding the canopy to the frame.",

I then wired the sticks and adjusted the fit of everything. \n\nThe copilot stick is removable so the wires exit just above joint on the right side. There are only two wires for the copilot stick push-to-talk button. The pilot stick has 7 wires for the trim control, radio flip flop, radio push-to-talk, and autopilot disconnect. The wires exit from the bottom of the stick. I\u2019ll wire these to a connector in order to make it removable. \n\nA few years back when moving to the hangar, I somehow lost the center tunnel cover. So I had to make a new one, which took a couple hours. \n\nHere you can see it (in gray) under the center console arm rest. \n\nThe center console mounts to the flap cover and sits quite snug over the tunnel cover. This makes it rock solid for leaning on and using it to get in and out of the plane. \n\nThe last thing I did was to replace the NyLock nuts on my throttle bracket with all metal nuts. \n\nThis has been on my todo list for a long time and I just needed to knock it out. \n\nNext time I\u2019ll wrap up the control stick installation with the wiring and then the sticks are done!",

        "text": "February has been a bit of a slower month in making big progress. I've spent a few evenings working on several different things. I got some new shelving units from an old storage unit that my mom was getting rid of, and they sat in the hangar for a few weeks before I finally got some time to assemble them and reorganize a lot of the stuff we have. \n\nI spent an evening with my wife moving the old shelves and workbenches to opposite sides of the hangar, and moved the new shelves to the back wall (they're much bigger) and just general organizing of tools and parts and a lot of clean up. \n\nWe also made a trip to the Container Store and got more plastic boxes for stuff. Its always satisfying when putting things back on shelves and seeing how organized it is at the end.\n\nI came back a few days later and worked through a short to-do list of things inside the plane. I needed to shorten the elevator pushrods so that the bellcrank would rotate aft a small amount. When I pushed the elevator fully forward, it would get a little \"squishy\" and if I pushed harder, it would then hit the forward (down) stop. I figured the only thing that could be causing this is that I was over rotating the autopilot servo, which is attached to the bellcrank. After shortening the pushrods, I reinstalled everything and tested the forward (and aft) stop, everything hit their stops with no problem or squishiness felt anymore. I then torqued all the bolts and marked them with torque paint. \n\nAs I was working on the larger aft pushrod, I noticed that the aft fuselage skin still needed to be riveted. Its the portion right under the empennage, totaling ~50 rivets. I'm surprised I didnt notice this earlier, but It would have been caught when I started doing the fiberglass work on the empennage fairing. I realized I needed to remove the horizontal stabilizer in order to sufficiently gain access to rivet these holes. I proceeded to remove the tail and then riveted the aft skin with no issues and then reinstalled the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. \n\nNow that I have the elevator and rudder off the plane, I will be working on the fiberglass tips.",

The paint is a urethane automotive paint. I picked a dark gray. It\u2019s almost exactly in between the black and lighter gray of the leather on seats and side panels. It will be a nice bridge to tie the whole interior together. \n\nI also painted the roll bar and the canopy frame in preparation for bonding the canopy. This was the last step before permanently bonding the canopy. I also painted a few other interior parts like the flap motor housing and side panels, as well as the arm rest that I will be installing. The last thing I painted is the side rails and cross bar that side behind the seats. The rest of the interior will either be covered by side panels/pockets or carpeting. \n\nI also temporarily installed the rudder so I can finish the rudder cable and pedal installation. \n\nEven just adding the rudder makes the plane seem a whole lot more complete than without it. \n\nI also permanently installed both NACA ducts for the air vents. The ducts were held in place while the epoxy cured.\n\nOnce I reinstall the panel I can fit the vents to the panel and measure the tubing.",

        "text": "This weekend I spent time preparing to bond the canopy to the frame. I needed to finish the canopy latch mechanism installation. I decided to modify the design slightly based on some builders logs I\u2019ve read.\n\nThe latch is installed with a spring and washer that prevents it from being rotated and locked unless the handled is pulled down. This should prevent any accidental locking of the latch when no one is inside. \n\nHere it is in the locked position. I\u2019ve also added some UHMW plastic on the underside of the roll bar to protect the metal. \n\nOnce I finished the install I got to prepping the roll bar and frame for the Sikaflex glue that will be used for bonding. \n\nI masked the whole roll bar to prevent glue from accidentally sticking to it. I\u2019ve added some 1/8\u201d spacers to the top of the bar in order to ensure the proper gap between the canopy frame and the canopy. These will hold the canopy up the required spacing above the frame. The frame and the roll bar are perfectly level with each other, so this will ensure an even gap and the appropriate amount of glue. \n\nI then clamped the frame to the roll bar with the proper spacing blocks between the two. I also added side rail clamps that will hold the canopy in place when the glue cures. Now that all the preparations are in place I can get the canopy ready to bond. \n\nI also ordered some foam and leather from Classic Aero Designs, the company that made the rest of my interior, in order to make an armrest. \n\nIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve worked with leather and foam like this, so I may attempt to redo it, but its much nicer than resting my arm on solid metal. I have enough material to make two more if I find the desire to remake it.",

        "text": "This weekend was a big weekend. \n\nTest fitting the canopy for final adjustments\n\nMy friend Norio came to help with the install. We started by dry fitting the canopy and marking it for exact alignment. We walked through the process and the execution plan. \n\nCleaning the glue joint\n\nThe entire process will involve Sikaflex. It\u2019s a three part marine UV resistant glue. We first wipe down the mating surfaces withe Sika Aktivator 205. This preps the surface for the next step. \n\nCanopy frame primed. \n\nCanopy primed\n\nWe waited the required 10 minutes for the Aktivator to do its magic then we primed the surfaces with the Sika 209D primer. This stuff is quite nasty. We then waiting 30 minutes. The primer goes through three phases: very runny liquid, tacky, perfectly smooth and cured. At this point we have an hour and a half to apply the adhesive. \n\nApplying adhesive \n\nI started at the top of the frame and began applying the bead of Sika 295UV adhesive. I cut a V notch in the applicator tip in order to get the appropriate amount of glue for the bead. Sikaflex recommend 1/8\u201d thickness to allow for thermal expansion. \n\nI worked my way around the perimeter of the frame, along the sides and then finished off at the front of the frame. \n\nI\u2019ve read many posts about this process and every one of them said that they needed more adhesive. So I was hoping this would be enough  \n\nGetting ready to drop the canopy on\n\nNorio and I then grabbed the canopy and prepped to install it. As we put it into place my wife Britney was there to make sure it was aligned to our marks (and take awesome photos). \n\nCarefully going over the prop\n\nAligning the bubble before dropping into position \n\nAligning and tightening the side clamps \n\nI managed to climb inside to add the final touches and to fill any gaps. \n\nFilling the forward canopy \n\nI just barely managed to fit the applicator tip in the gap above the dash. I then used my finger to create a nice fillet. \n\nI climbed back out and we did some final checks.  We ended up adding a ratchet strap to hold the forward part of the canopy down. \n\nI went back the next morning to check the curing of the canopy. Everything looked great! It was a huge relief. I started removing the clamps. \n\nGetting the excess glue off\n\nI propped the canopy up so I could get under it and clean up the areas where there was excess squeeze out of the glue. \n\nI also flipped it over to check for any gaps. I needed to add some glue on the rear of the canopy frame where I didn\u2019t have access during the initial fitting. \n\nhttps://videopress.com/v/Q1fo12ek?resizeToParent=true&cover=true&preloadContent=metadata&useAverageColor=true\n\nFirst time opening the canopy\n\nThe whole experience was really great. The process was quite straightforward once I read through all the Sikaflex documentation (and referenced many posts on Vans Air Force). The whole process took around 3 hours from test fitting to finished install, with an additional couple hours the next day.",

I decided to install additional LED lights under the shelf to illuminate this area along side the rest of the panel. \n\nIn doing this installation I also decided to install an accessory (auxiliary) bus for several different components. Right now they are Panel Lighting, Bluetooth Receiver, CO monitor (may update this one), and USB power ports. I utilized a slim fuse block that has 8 slots, and I wired it up to a 15A pin on the VPX. It's not currently wired up to a switch, but can be switched on/off via the VPX controls on the EFIS. \n\nI also spent some time updating the routing of ground wires to the ground block.

This was an iterative process, but adding a 1/8\" gapping tool to the roll bar helped to ensure consistent gap. The plans call for 1/32\" but that is just wayyy too small of a gap. Part of the reason I decided to go with the Sikaflex method of attachment rather than screws is to account for thermal expansion between the metal and plexi without damaging the plexi, however a 1/32\" gap is so small that any thermal expansion will lock the two together. \n\nI spent most of the time trimming the aft section of the rear window to fit under the skin as well as ensuring enough overlap under the skin for the Sikaflex. Once I had a decent fit and the appropriate clearances between the canopy and rear window, I removed the window and began prepping the aluminum surfaces and masking the edges. \n\nLastly, I have been annoyed by the canopy latch fingers and how much force is needed to un-latch the canopy.

Years ago I added wiring provisions for adding a tail-mounted camera, but did not know what I would do in the long run. I decided to mount a wide angle mini camera to the top of the vertical stabilizer. \n\nI wired the camera up and fed the signal into the Dynon EFIS.

I then installed the appropriate rivets and used my squeezer to knock those out. I had to use longer rivets in a couple places where I used washers to get the appropriate spacing. I couldn't reach the aft two rivets on either side with my squeezer, so I used the rivet gun. I also riveted the canopy handle to the pilots side of the canopy. \n\nI then began prepping the rear window and aft skin for bonding. Same process as before. I wiped down all the mating surfaces with the Sika Activator, waited 10 minutes and then primed all the surfaces. \n\nLooking down at the primed surface on the rear window\n\nOriginally I was going to use short pieces of teflon coated wire as spacers for the rear window and then remove them after the glue sets (described by Bruce here) , but decided to use small pieces of 1/8\" thick rubber. These were small enough and dense enough that they could be placed on the rollbar and completely encased in the SikaFlex. \n\nI then applied a bead of SikaFlex to the rollbar and to the rear window. Installing the window was a big of a challenge, and it did get quite messy, but i got everything aligned and clamped (I wish I had 4 more clamps). \n\nAnother idea I stole from Bruce was the rear window aft supports. I fabricated a similar support and it worked great to hold the aft part of the window up against the interior of the fuselage skin. Once things set up a bit, I removed the masking tape and cleaned up all the edges.",

It looked very very clean. Really started to make the plane look more like a plane. \n\nNow that the canopy was done, and the rear window was done, I also decided to remove the plastic from the canopy.

        "text": "This weekend I hit a huge milestone - my buddy Norio and I installed the wings on the plane! \n\nWe started by first leveling the plane to make sure we had the ability to, as well as thinking it would make sliding the spars into the fuselage easier. \n\nOnce the plane was level, we began the process of installing the wing. Once we got the main spar on the left wing mostly installed, we needed to make quite a few adjustments in order for the bolt holes to line up. We eventually got the correct dihedral angle which caused the first bolt to slip in nicely. I kept the bolts in the freezer overnight to help shrink them a little, then applied some lube to aid in the bolt install. \n\nI hopped into the cabin to get the second bolt inserted. It took a bit of coercion, as I think there may be some micro-misalignment with the fuselage structure causing quite a tight fit. I used an alignment pin that I built using some store-bought hardware. it definitely helps to get the spar in the right spot. \n\nOnce the second bolt was in, I got out and Norio was able to let go of the wingtip. The plane now had one wing! The whole process for the first wing took about an hour, because there was quite a bit of figuring things out with respect to angles and alignment. After taking a quick break, we jumped onto the second wing. At this point, my wife joined us and helped get the second wing installed in about 20 minutes. It was much smoother. \n\nOnce both wings were installed with a couple bolts, we began the rigorous process of measuring wing sweep, incidence, and symmetry. We started by first using a laser level to mark a straight line on the ground spanning the wings, that will be used to measure sweep. We then hung four plumb bobs off the leading edge of the wings and began to align them with the laser line. We also aligned the fuselage longitudinally with the laser, so we could later measure the squareness of the whole plane. At this point, we measured the sweep, and both wings were about 1/4\" swept forward. Van's calls for fore/aft sweep within 1/2\" from center, so it was already within spec, but I knew we could make minor adjustments to achieve a closer sweep angle. A few iterations of adjusting the rear spar, and we got the sweep to within 1/8\" of an inch. This equates to 0.2deg of sweep!\n\nAfter getting the sweep right, we clamped the rear spar attachment in place. Then we checked the incidence angle. The incidence is measured by spanning a level from the forward spar to the aft spar with a 3\" space above the aft spar. If this angle is 0 deg (or matches the fuselage angle - which was level at 0 deg) then the incidence is correct. Van's guidance is not so much the precision of 0.0 deg incidence, but that the two wings match. In my case the initial measurement was 0.3deg off from 0 on the left wing, and 0.4 deg on the right wing. At this point we made some minor adjustments by unclamping the rear spar and adjusting it downwards. this brought the angle on the left wing to 0.0deg, and the right wing also to 0.0deg! We clamped the wings, double checked the sweep, and also took a measurement from the wingtips to the aft center of the fuselage. Both those measurements were equal to each other. At this point we wrapped up for the day. \n\nThe next morning, we came back and double checked all the measurements with a fresh eye. Everything still measured perfectly. I got out my drill guide and drilled a #30 hole through the rear spar on the left wing. The center of this hole was > 5/8\" from all edges of the rear spars (on both wings) per the structural requirements. I then expanding it to a 1/4\" hole using the guide. After a 1/4\" I drilled the spar to 9/32 and then used a 0.311 reamer to finish the hole. The reason for doing this step is that the bolt is an AN5-10 bolt (measures 5/16\" in diameter), but the hole made by a 5/16\" drill bit is slightly bigger (a few thousandths). For the primary bolt that locks position of the wing, it should be a super snug fit. The bolt measures 0.3125\" in diameter, and the reamer is 15 thousandths smaller than the bolt. We did the same thing on the right wing. \n\nAt this point, we called it a day, but I got out the aileron pushrods and inserted them into the wings in preparation for rigging the controls. Similarly with the flaps, I temporarily installed the flaps to ensure that they could fully retract to the underside of the fuselage. Next time I'll finish the aileron control rigging and flap rigging.",

        "text": "With the wings on the fuselage I got the flaps onto the wings so I could fabricate the flap pushrods. I started by cutting the pushrod stock to length. I then tapped both ends of the rods for 1/4-28 rod-end bearings. The plans call to use a CM-4S bearing. \n\nThe problem with this is that because it\u2019s an integrated ball into the bearing, there is no way to prevent this from backing out. The instructions call for locktite to hold it in. I will be changing this out to a CM-4M rod-end bearing with a through bolt that can be safety wired. Its much more secure and safe this way.\n\nBut while those parts are on order, I still used the default part to do the initial fitting. I installed it onto the flap and then checked the alignment with the bottom of the fuselage. I then cut the hole in the fuselage that the pushrod passes through\n\nWhen I installed the bearing into the flap I did not put any spacers, but when I put the update rod end bearing I will be centering the bearing so its not rubbing against the side of the fuselage.\n\nWith both flaps on the plane, and aligned I was able to test the deflection of both flaps. Luckily everything was symmetric and the full flap deflection was 45deg. This is above the minimum of 40deg for the RV-7. \n\nWith the flaps installed, I then began the aileron aligning. I first began by ensuring the vertical-ness of the control sticks in the plane. When I initially aligned the pilots stick, the copilot stick was inboard by about 6deg. So I adjusted the connecting pushrod so that both sticks were perfectly aligned. It\u2019s hard to see in the pic below, but it says 89.7\u00b0, which is close enough for me. \n\nI used a long straight edge to align the aileron with the tooling holes on the outboard rib of the wing (per the instructions) and then ensure that it was aligned with the flaps. I then used the aileron alignment tool to ensure the bellcrank-to-aileron pushrod was the right length, and then, with the control sticks in the vertical position I adjusted the main pushrod. Once the left aileron was adjusted I did the same for the right side. Everything was perfectly aligned to within 0.1deg when comparing everything. \n\nI also got the lower fuselage skins drilled to the wing skins. This has to be done now so that I can remove the wings and install all the nutplates. I also temporarily installed the wing root fairings to drill those as well. They will also be attached with screws through nutplates. \n\nThe gap between the fairings and the fuselage will be opened up to 3/16\" and then a rubber seal will be added before permanently reinstalling it.\n\nI also recently saw a modification to the canopy installation that I really liked. Its a modification to the canopy lift struts geometry. I found it through this post (thanks Mike). It had some great guidelines, and only a slight modification was needed for my RV-7 (the post is for an RV-6).\n\nI measured 2\" back from the panel for the forward lift brackets. The canopy brackets were 24\" back from the leading edge of the canopy frame. The struts used are Suspa 23.86\" 20lb struts. I also purchased the brackets from there as well.\n\nThe initial fitting took some trial and error, but I got it all aligned and double checked the support capabilities. The entire canopy is very well supported all throughout the closing/opening trajectory. Whats really nice about this geometry is that the canopy is supported by the struts throughout the entire cycle, but with the original geometry there is an over-center position in which the struts begin to pull the canopy down, and it is quite unstable.\n\nHere you can see the original geometry vs the new geometry. One other big benefit to this geometry is the increased entry/exit area.",

        "text": "After rigging the ailerons and flaps and making sure everything was aligned, I needed to remove the wings one more time in order to finish up some critical items. The to-do list included finishing the Root Fairing seals and drilling two more holes for the Pitot and AOA tubes (for the left wing). The Root Fairing seals have about 20 nut plates that need to be riveted to the wing in order to accept the screws that hold everything together. This required removing the wing so I have access to the inboard rib of the wing to install everything.\n\nA few years back, a fellow builder, Vince, told me about a solo method to remove and install the wings using the wing cradle. If it wasn't for this guidance It would have been quite annoying to attempt this work by myself. The method involves putting the wing cradle under the wing when its temporarily installed in the plane, and then using some plywood clamped to the cradle to prop the wing up in its final orientation. \n\nI used some scrap plywood my friend Norio gave me, and cut it to size such that when clamped to the cradle, it fit snuggly under the wing. I then clamped everything and tightly as I could. I hopped into the plane and began the painstaking process of removing the bolts that had been temporarily holding the wing on. Its quite a tight and awkward fit, but I managed to remove everything. I then slowly removed the wing while it was held up by the wing cradle. Success! \n\nOnce I had the wing off, I began the process of drilling, countersinking, dimpling, and installing the nutplates to the inboard rib of the wing. This was pretty straightforward, nothing too challenging here. \n\nI also used this opportunity to drill two additional holes in the side of the fuselage for the pitot  and angle of attack lines. Its all quite a tight fit inside this area, so trying to make sure I had everything lined up appropriately. When I initially installed the lines, I mistakenly cut one of them a couple inches too short. In this pic you can see a short segment that is used to attach everything. After taking this pic I added a longer segment in the wing under one of the access panels (where its easier to work) in order to remove this short segment under the floor pan. \n\nI Also needed to attach the nutplate to the fuel tank bracket. This is an AN4 bolt that will slip away in the event that the wing impacts something, in order to prevent the fuel tank from rupturing to minimize the risk of a fire. The bolt here will be safety wired. \n\nOnce I had everything drilled, and all the nutplates installed, I reinstalled the wing. The wing cradle method worked absolutely flawlessly, and makes installing the wings solo completely reasonable. I then installed all of the bolts that hold the wing, as this is the final time the wings will come off! \n\nThe next day, I went back to the hangar to repeat the entire process on the right wing. This one took me about 50% less time, which was nice. Now that the wings are permanently installed, I can now wire up the wingtip lights, and autopilot servo, which will close out the two remaining avionics to-do items.",

        "text": "Now that the wings are installed I spent a couple hours working on some remaining wiring tasks inside the fuselage. I drilled two holes through my center section (with the guidance from this post on vansaircraft.com) in order to route my autopilot and right wingtip lighting harnesses forward of the spar. The left side wingtip lighting harness was routed through an existing hole. I will then connect the wires up to the existing wires that were in place already. I also routed the Fuel Level sensor wires through the sides of the fuselage as well. Once these last few connections are complete, the entire avionics and wiring of the aircraft will be complete.\n\nI also took this opportunity to install my wing-walk grip. I ordered custom skateboard grip tape from www.boardpusher.com, and they turned out amazing! I cut them to final size by laying them on the wing and trimming as necessary. \n\nI came back the next day and began wiring up the lighting harnesses and the roll servo. It was a quick job to splice the wires together and secure the bundle forward of the spar. \n\nI got my wingtips out and propped them up on the wings. I connected the included ZipTip wiring connector and powered up the panel. On first try, the left wingtip taxi and landing light both failed to turn on, while the right side worked nominally. I then began to trace the break in the line, starting with just powering the wingtip with a power supply directly via the wiring harness. I went to disconnect the harness, and one of the ground wires separated from the connector. The ZipTips utilize two grounds - one for landing/taxi lights, and one for nav/strobe. I popped the pin out of the connected, re-stripped the wire and re-crimped a new pin. When I plugged it in, everything worked as expected!\n\nWith the panel powered up, I also updated the autopilot servo software to the latest version. When it came back online, I calibrated the servo and verified that everything worked as expected. Its fun to see the autopilot try to maneuver the plane!",

And 2. the quality is impeccable. Everything is superb in fit, and finish, and it really makes the plane feel like a premium aircraft.\n\nI received some guidance on the installation process, so I began by laying out the carpet in the plane to mark the locations. I then installed the velcro chips (Velcoins) that are used to hold the carpet down. They are pop-riveted to the floor pans and then the carpet is attached. \n\nI then proceeded to install the seat backs, cushions and stick boot covers to really get a sense of what the interior will look like. \n\nIn the next few days I will install the remainder of the interior (for initial fitting) including the side panels, pockets, armrests, forward carpet, baggage carpet and baggage side panels as well as rear cover.

        "text": "Happy New Year! I wrapped up 2023 and kicked off 2024 by completing the wingtip installation. I am using the Aveo Engineering ZipTip Premier wingtips that have integrated lights. These include Landing, Taxi, Nav and Strobe lights with a rear position/strobe light as well. They recently announced a completely new and upgraded version - Vegas. Check them out, I may upgrade in the future.\n\nI started the installation by trimming the inboard edges of the wingtips to 5/8\" width. This is so that they sit flush with the wing skins. I also trimmed back the trailing edge to provide 1/4\" gap to the aileron. \n\nI then used my ratchet strap to hold the wingtip in the right position and snug up against the leading edge. \n\nWith the strap holding the wingtip to the wing, I drilled #40 and clecoed all the holes top and bottom. Then I removed the strap. I also used this opportunity to verify the lighting was working as expected. I drilled the left wingtip, then the right followed the same process. \n\nI removed every other Cleco and drilled to #27 for the -6 screws I'll be using. Once all the holes were drilled I removed the wingtips and began the tedious process of drilling and installing the nutplates.\n\nI made a small nutplate jig using a -6 screw, and use that to drill all the rivet holes for the nut plates. \n\nafter drilling everything I countersunk all the rivet holes and the screw holes. The screw holes need to be counter sunk big enough to accept the dimple from the wing skin. After that, I riveted all the nutplates on to the wingtip. I repeated this process with the right wingtip. \n\nOnce everything was riveted, I installed the wingtips to the plane and ran the harness through to the lighting module. I powered up the panel and did a test of the lights. It was night time so I used this opportunity to test out the performance of the lights at night. They are very bright. I may need to make some minor adjustments to the taxi light angle somehow, but they are sufficient for now. \n\nThe whole process took me approximately 8 hours for all the trimming, fitting, drilling and riveting. Nothing was difficult, just tedious. I wanted to start the fiberglass work with the wingtips for this reason. Now I can proceed to rest of the fiberglass work!",

This included tightening the jam nuts on all the pushrods and ensuring that a sufficient number of threads are available on either end to ensure that if something does come loose, nothing can fully unscrew. I then marked everything with torque paint. \n\nWhile I had the floor pans out and working on the aileron pushrods, I decided to install the aileron pushrod boots. These are leather covers that attach over the pushrods to prevent air from entering the cabin. They are from Classic Aero Designs and were quite easy to install. The provided instructions are very clear. Another great product to go with my complete interior! \n\nIn parallel to all the above items, I began working on some of the fiberglass parts on the plane. Starting with the Horizontal and Vertical Stabilizer tips. They are pop-riveted to the surfaces, and have some foam and fiberglass filling to close gaps around the attachments. I also filled the gaps and glassed over the joint after riveting them to the surfaces. This is an iterative process and the epoxy curing time allows for a lot of work to get done in between. I'm using the West System Epoxy 105A (and 205A hardener). They make it super easy with the pumps - 1 pump from each is exactly the amount for proper mixing. This is going to take a few iterations to complete, but once the surfaces are bonded and glassed, I will paint over them with some primer to seal the whole thing.",

        "text": "I added some more epoxy and filler to the tail fiberglass tip fairings, and while that was curing I spent some time wrapping up additional finish items. \n\nI started by marking the wing root fairings for a 3/16th\" gap. I marked the fairing with some black sharpie, and then used a 3/8\" bolt to score a small line, resulting in a 3/16th\" gap from the side of the fuselage. I then removed the fairings from the wings and used my snips to cut back to this line. I then filed this edge to smooth out the cut. After this I installed the rubber seal that will bridge this gap, and reinstalled the fairing to the wings. \n\nAfter this I spent some time inside the cabin installing support braces for the panel. Originally, the design has two large ribs that extend from the firewall all the way back to the panel through the sub panel, making the entire structure very rigid when riveted all together. With my panel design however, I removed those ribs between the sub panel and the panel so that I can fit all my avionics. As a result, I needed to fabricate some new supports that I can install between the sub panel and panel so as to not lose any rigidity. I fabricated the supports out of some 3/4\" angle stock, and cut to length so I could use my avionics trays as the anchor point on the panel, and then drilled two holes through the sub panel for a screw to hold the supports.\n\nWhile I was in the cabin, I finished securing all the wiring below the seat floors and in front of the spar. Additionally I also added rubber edging to the fuel line passthrough holes in the sides of the fuselage so the steel braided hoses won't rub against the fuselage. I will additional silicone tape around the hoses to make an air tight seal (or at least more of a seal).\n\nI also added the four remaining wing spar bolts. They are AN4-13A bolts that are inserted from the aft side of the center-section spar into some nutplates on the wing spar. These bolts are often missed as they are not part of the larger main bolts that go through the entire assembly. (The paint marker got a little runny)",

It\u2019s not perfect, but more than good enough until final paint. The horizontal stabilizers also have some final filler added and will be sanded and primed next time. \n\nThe whole process involves some West Systems epoxy, cotton flox, 60 grit, 150 grit, and 320 grit sand paper. Lots of sanding. \n\nTail is almost done done, then I can finish up the remaining fiberglass work on the canopy, and then do the cowl. Things are coming together!",

        "text": "The last month has seen quite a lot of progress on lots of small items. Every trip to the hangar involves more fiberglass and epoxy sanding and finishing. The fiberglass tips for the whole tail are now complete, barring the horizontal and vertical stabilizer tips being primed. I also completed the lower rudder fairing, which needed to be modified because I'm not installing a rear tail light.\n\nI also bolted and torqued all the elevator and rudder bolts, as well the elevator pushrod and rudder cables. \n\nWhile waiting for epoxy to cure I spent some time installing the wheel pant brackets to the landing gear. I had been putting it off as I didn't have a method to jack the airplane up. I also filled the brake system with fluid and bled the brakes until clear bubble-free fluid came out of the return line. \n\nI also began the process of making the canopy fairing. Its the final step to complete the canopy, and I waited to finish the tail fiberglass parts in order to build up confidence and process to ensure a smooth execution. I began by masking the window and the frame to make a 2 inch gap for the fairing. \n\nI then mixed up some epoxy and flox to make a thick filler, and then spread it in the gap between the window the canopy frame and then covered it in the peel-ply. \n\nI came back the next day and removed the peel-ply and then started sanding the surface. There were quite a lot of pits from the initial pass, so I mixed up a second batch and filled the gaps. \n\nAfter sanding again I still had a couple spots that needed filling so I did a third pass of the filler. \n\nAfter one final round of sanding I\u2019ll lay up the fiberglass and build the actual fairing. But that\u2019s for next time.",

        "text": "In my continued expansion into the Fiberglass world, I decided to work on the Tail Fairing.\n\nThe initial fit was not perfect, but I've tried my best with sanding and a heat gun to try and massage the fiberglass into a better position around the tail. \n\nAfter a few iterations of sanding to get the edges nice and straight, I used my hole-finder to match drill the fairing to the holes in the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. I used my heat gun and a long metal ruler to mold the fairing to the vertical stabilizer where there were some gaps. Once the alignment was as good as I could get it, I drilled the holes to #27 for #6 screws. I then riveted the nut-plates. \n\nI also spent some time adding the vertical stabilizer top fairing rear cover. I used some foam as filler and epoxied it in place. I then used 3 layers of fiberglass on top to complete the cover. This will get sanded and blended to the fairing then primed. \n\nI also did some layups of fiberglass on the canopy fairing. I used 5 layers of fiberglass starting smaller width and getting wider until it was the full 2 inch width. After curing, I began the tedious job of more sanding. I had to use quite a lot of filler to get the surface smooth, but eventually was at a point that I could remove the initial thick pipe tape and switch to thinner electrical tape and begin smoothing the transition. I also did an initial priming of the fairing and added some more filling. The primer helps to show the high and low spots so I can more easily fill and blend. I think another iteration and this should be good to go.",

        "text": "I spent some time working on the underside fairing for the tail. I decided to go with the standard Van's design using the aluminum close out and the rubber seals. It needed some trimming to get a consistent gap along the bottom of the horizontal stab, but once it was in place, I then installed the rubber fairing and attached it with some glue. \n\nI'll remove these and reinforce the rubber attachment to the aluminum with some stronger glue or epoxy. \n\nI also needed to redo the vertical stabilizer top fairing. After the epoxy cured and everything was sanded, the rudder and the fairing were slightly misaligned. I removed the fiberglass gap fairing and re-did the layup, clamping the rudder and the fairing together to ensure proper alignment. \n\nUp until now I had decided to not use a keyed ignition system, However I was talking to a hangar neighbor about avionics and panels and after talking with him for a while, I changed my mind and decided to add a key in line with the engine start button. The key is a 2 pole switch that essentially enables the engine start button to prevent accidentally engaging the engine starter. I've got some additional panel labels on order for the key and some other items that I have since added. \n\nAlso in this picture is the Rudder Trim knob I got from Aerosport Products. I hooked it up to the rudder pedals via the provided springs and checked the tension to ensure it was working properly. Whats nice about this approach to rudder trim is that it also provides a steady back pressure on the rudder pedals (via the springs). I've read that some mechanical yaw damping is nice to have, and this achieves that without having to keep feet on the pedals the entire time.",

I installed the firewall flanges to support the top cowl. I'm using 3\" spacing along the top center and then it transitions to 3.25\" spacing towards the sides. The two outermost flanges will align with bottom cowl flanges. \n\nOnce I aligned the top cowl and it was evenly aligned I trimmed the trailing edge to mate with the fuselage skins. I'll need to massage the edge a bit to a perfect fit, but it\u2019s good enough for an initial fitting. The orange strap will be for holding the bottom cowl up. \n\nI removed all the flanges, dimpled and surface prepped them so they can be riveted to the firewall. I\u2019m going to hold off on this until everything has been fitted. \n\nI also cut out the hole for the oil door. The door is a separate piece that gets fitted to the cowl with a hinge. I traced the door onto the cowl and then created a 1/2\u201d flange. I aligned the hinge to the cowl and the door and clecoed it in place. \n\nI also cut the slot for the latch mechanism. \n\nHere it is in the closed position. After some more sanding and shaping of the door I riveted everything in place. \n\nI added a stiffener plate to the inside of the door using some scrap material from the cowl.

I then reinstalled the top cowl and drilled every-other hole to cleco it to the flanges \n\nI started in the middle and worked my way to the sides in order to keep everything as tight and flush as possible. These holes will get enlarged to accept the skybolt fasteners. \n\nHere is the other side. The oil door has been removed for now so I don\u2019t damage it. \n\nThere are some minor gaps where the cowl meets the fuselage skins.

I've spaced out the holes resulting in 17 skybolts across the top cowl. \n\nI drilled each other hole to full size with my unibit and then full size with a 15/32\" bit. I then placed the grommets in the holes and the SkyBolt receptacle on the underside and used the studs to whole the cowl in place while I removed the clecos and drilled the remaining holes.\n\nOnce all the holes were drilled I removed the cowl and put the temporary grommet retainers on the underside to hold the grommets in place. SkyBolt provides a more permanent retaining clip, but the intention is to only apply those once the cowl is painted. \n\nI then installed all the studs into the grommets using the SkyBolt stud pliers. \n\nI then removed all the flanges from the firewall and prepped, primed and riveted the receptacles onto the flanges. \n\nI then re-clecoed the flange-receptacles back to the firewall, and reinstalled the top cowl. I then set all the studs into the receptacles. This allows me to set the appropriate depth for the studs. I then removed the studs with a quick quarter turn, which leaves the depth unchanged, but removes the studs. I then removed the top cowl and removed all the anti-lock pins from the receptacles, which makes the depth permanent. \n\nWith the top cowl now fixed to the firewall, I can temporarily install the lower cowl. This took some annoying trial-and-error, but I managed to install the lower cowl and secure it in place with a ratchet-strap. \n\nWith the cowl temporarily held in place, I was able to align the front of the cowl and drill the three attach holes at the forward joint behind the spinner. \n\nI also scored the bottom cowl where it aligns with the firewall, as well as the sides. The instructions say to cut the bottom first which allows the cowl to fully seat upwards against the lower fuselage.\n\nThen I can cut the sides to match the fuselage.\n\nHere you can see the flanges on the sides and bottom. \n\nOnce the flanges were on I was able to drill the lower cowl using the click adapter. I drilled the two on the side with the oil door as it was easier to access. Then removed the top cowl to drill the remaining holes on both sides. \n\nThe lower cowl can now support itself which will allow me to trim the sides to match the top cowl, followed by adding the last skybolts along the sides of the cowl to attach top to bottom.",

        "text": "The last step in finishing the cowling installation is adding the SkyBolts to the split-line to join the top and bottom cowls.\n\nI started out by marking the lower and upper cowl split-lines where they overlapped in order to make the top and bottom edges mate perfectly. Once Everything was marked, I used a long straight sanding block to sand back the edge of the lower cowl until it perfectly met the top cowl. \n\nNext step was to add the flanges to the lower cowl. The goal here is to perfectly align the flanges with the top cowl flange at a 90\u00ba angle. I did this by first establishing how far down onto the lower cowl the flanges should sit, which was 1/2\" below the split line. I lined up one of the flanges with the top cowl flange and marked the lower edge of the flange. \n\nI then marked a 1/2\" line along the bottom cowl, and then established the appropriate spacing. I chose 3.25\" spacing between SkyBolts which would result in 10 (9 additional) SkyBolts across the split line.\n\nOnce everything was marked, I then drew vertical lines from the bottom cowl onto the top cowl at the 3.25\" spacing. I now had the lower flange limit and the vertical alignment, and was able to mark the location on the top cowl for where to drill a number 30 pilot hole for the SkyBolts.\n\nI marked the 9 additional holes, and then drilled them to number 30. This allowed me to cleco the flanges to the top cowl aligned with the bottom cowl along the split-line.\n\nOnce the flanges were all clecoed, I drilled all the holes to the lower cowl for the flange rivets. I then moved the flanges to the inside and drilled the top cowl skybolt pilot holes to the final size of 15/32\" and installed the grommets to the top cowl. \n\nI also countersunk all the rivet holes on the bottom cowl. Then, I removed the top cowl and installed all the grommet retaining O-rings and installed the studs.\n\nI then repeated this on both sides of the cowl and ensured everything is properly aligned.\n\nAfter everything was fit and ready for permanent installation, I primed and prepped the flanges and installed the receptacles.\n\nI then installed the flanges to the cowl with epoxy in prep for riveting. \n\nI came back the next day, after the epoxy had cured and used the provided rivets from SkyBolt to rivet the flanges to the cowl. \n\nThe last step in finalizing the cowl installation is the forward inlet mounting screws. I drilled the holes with a number 10 bit for the -8 screws and marked the lower cowl for the nutplates rivet locations, countersunk the holes, and installed the nutplates. The cowl can now be screwed in at the forward inlets completing the installation",

I trimmed several pieces around the aft part of the engine to better fit, as well as around the valve covers. Once the baffles were installed, I put the lower cowl on. \n\nImmediately I needed to trim the lower inlet ramps to fit under the cowl lip, since the lower cowl could not be installed with the ramps untrimmed. \n\nWith the baffle on i fabricated some spacer blocks to hold the top cowl up 5\" - based on this post by Bruce (slightly modified to make it easier to reach). \n\nI used the scribe attached to a sharpie pen, which measured 5.5\" and used it to scribe along the outside of the baffles under the cowl. I then marked the scribe line with that sharpie and trimmed baffle back to the line. With the top cowl reinstalled, I was able to get a glimpse of the gap after trimming. \n\nI then added a bunch of paper clips to the baffle to use as a measure to get a 1/2\" gap. Since I'm going to build a plenum, I may try to get a little extra room here. \n\nI then trimmed the baffles down where the paperclips indicated the need. I also trimmed the forward baffles to better fit under the cowl inlets. It will take a bit to improve the fit.",

I started by fabricating a spacer to fit in the inlet hole. \n\nThis allowed me to temporarly align the snorkel to the inlet. The starter motor had a lug that was interfering with the snorkel, so I removed it.\n\nWith the snorkel rotated up as much as possible, and aligned with the baffle ramp, I trimmed the sides to align with the fuel servo.\n\nI moved the mixture knob all the way forward, and found that it interfered with the snorkel. I used my heat gun to soften the snorkel and pressed in with the butt of my screw driver to create an indentation. Once the snorkel cooled down, it was solid again, and left 1/4\" clearance around the mixture arm. I will seal the snorkel with some additional epoxy which should increase the strength in this location, incase any was lost with the softening.\n\nWith the inlet ramps installed, I was able to align and fit the snorkel to the baffle. I then drilled the holes to mount the snorkel to the inlet.\n\nI trimmed down the snorkel to fit under the baffle by about 3/8\". This allows for enough clearance under the baffle for the servo mounting flanges to fit.\n\nThis will get fitted to the lower baffle ramp a bit more and will secure the filter.",

        "text": "Now that the baffles are all trimmed, riveted and in place on the engine, I started work on the plenum. The plenum is an alternative to the baffle seals that Vans provides. The original design uses the seals on the baffles to press up against the top cowl creating a seal to prevent air from escaping outside the baffles. The plenum acts as a seal, but is fabricated from fiberglass and attaches directly to the baffles like a lid. \n\nThere are many sources for how to build a plenum online. I'm going to combine several methods I've seen. One of them is from Dan Horton on vans airforce and another from Pete Howell as well. Both describe how to build a model above the engine to allow for laying up of fiberglass.\n\nI started by laying down some plastic on the engine. I got some two part expanding foam, and mixed up a small test sample before doing the big pours. Once that went well, I mixed up a batch and began pouring it on the engine.\n\nWorking on batches makes this a lot easier. The foam takes about 30s to mix, and then about 10 minutes to fully expand and harden. Here is the fully covered engine. I need to use the plastic in places to prevent the foam from spilling over. \n\nI then used a hand saw and a rasp and sanding blocking to begin shaping the foam. The final result is a plenum shaped mold. I also began covering this with packing tape. I will continue shaping the inlets after the plenum is made.\n\nThe foam around and in the cowl inlets will be trimmed away before molding the fiberglass. The distance from the plenum/baffles to the cowl will be opened up to 3/8\" to allow for enough room to fabricate gap seals.",

        "text": "Today I had my friend Norio help me out on the actual fiberglass layup of the Plenum. He's a seasoned composites expert and has helped me on many other parts (canopy, wings) of the plane as well.\n\nI started the day by finishing off trimming the foam around the inlets, and covering the rest of the foam with packing tape. I then laid a sheet of plastic over the top to prevent epoxy from getting on anything.\n\nI planned on using four layers of fiberglass and a 1/8\" core to provide strength. I laid out the first layer and cut it to size around the compound corners of the baffles. I repeated this for all the layers. We then began the layup. \n\nWe used squeegees and brushes to push the epoxy and saturate the two bottom layers. I alternated a 2x2 twill weave with a 1x1 straight weave. \n\nI shaped the core material a bit and cut it to sit around the shape of the mold. We then added the top two layers in reverse: 1x1 straight and 2x2 twill on top. Here is a close up of the finished plenum with the core material clearly visible between the layers (the barcoded part). There are some voids right near the core that I will fill later. There is a solid two inches around the perimeter that has no gaps or voids.\n\nWe then weighed the entire thing down using some foam to distribute the load then left it to cure overnight.\n\nAfter this sets up, I will remove the plastic cover and trim the edges. If i need to reinforce anything or redo any parts, I will add subsequent layers and filler material. The whole lid can experience a couple hundred pounds of force at high speeds, so it needs to be stiff enough to not flex, which may open up gaps (reduce cooling) or cause the whole thing to crack.\n\nThe final step to this project will be creating the cowl inlet seals which will join the cowl inlets to the plenum preventing any air from leaking around the engine.",

        "text": "I went back to the airport to finish up the plenum. Its fully cured and super strong. The core adds a significant amount of stiffness while keeping the whole thing very light.\n\nI removed the top plastic and the whole plenum just popped right off. I then trimmed the excess material around the perimeter.\n\nit took a few iterations, but I was able to get it to fit quite nicely. There are some gaps that I will fill, but the overall fit is going to be more than sufficient. \n\nThe core material being asymmetrical is one thing that does annoy me, but its mostly asthetic at this point. The plenum will get sanded smooth and then another thin coat of tinted epoxy and some paint to finish it off.\n\nI spent a majority of the time today working on the inlets, trimming and fitting the plenum to better align. \n\nI opened the gap up to 3/8\" to provide enough room for the gap seals that I will fabricate. I used some test material to check the fit, and it will work.\n\nThe left inlet needs some work on the outboard side. I will likely build up the plenum top again with some additional fiberglass. The height of the plenum lines up perfectly with the cowl inlet, but the gap is about 1/2\" instead of 3/8\". \n\nHere is the upper inboard side of the left inlet, the gap here is much better. the test gap seal fits much nicer around this side. On the lower side I will have to work the seal around the filter, which will likely result in an odd shaped seal.\n\nI'm waiting for a shipment of some AA3  .032 1\"x1\" aluminum angle from Vans. I will rivet it to the baffles and then the plenum will screw to the angles.\n\nThere are a couple things I learned during this process:\n\nI should have installed the angle brackets first, and then pour the foam to create the mold. Then I could use the angle brackets to perfectly align the foam, which would result in a perfect fit rather than a mostly perfect fit.\n\nI would have used six layers of fiberglass and no core material (or maybe plan the shape a bit more). There are some voids around the core edges, which I can fix, but I think six layers would be more than strong enough for this application.\n\nGet enough sand bags to apply enough even weight across the entire surface. \n\nI'm sure there are other learnings, but these are top of mind from today. If I make another plenum, I would do it this way next time.",

        "text": "I've been going back and forth on how to best attach the plenum to the engine baffles. I've seen it done several different ways. One involves riveting aluminum angle to the baffles and then adding nutplates to the angles and attaching the plenum from the top. Another way is to build up a fiberglass flange that overlaps the baffle and then adding nutplates to the inside of the baffle directly.\n\nWithout fully deciding which method(s) to go with, I started with the sides and front. Fiberglass flanges here will help to create a pretty rock solid seal, as well as help to prevent any stress fractions (which I've seen in some designs). The rear part of the baffle is the part I'm still debating whether to build up a fiberglass flange, or install the angle.\n\nI scuffed and prepped the plenum sides and then I started laying up the flanges. I cut four layers of 9oz cloth to size, and mocked the layup before pouring the epoxy.\n\nI used some peel-ply to try and absorb some of the extra epoxy, but it was a pretty simple layup.\n\nI didn't get any pictures, but the other side looked nearly the same.\n\nI came back the next day, and trimmed and cleaned up the edges, and sanded the surface back smooth. I will add some filler to finish out any of the low spots prior to painting.\n\nI drilled the sides to the baffles to temporarily hold it in place, and then prepped to do the forward layup next.\n\nHeres the right side, I will drill these holes to 5/32\" for a -8 screw and add nutplates to the inside of the baffles.\n\nThe forward layup was a bit more tricky, as it is a complex shape with several bends. I cut the fiberglass to follow the contours and began the layup. Heres the right half of the forward section.\n\nAnd the left side. I will trim the flange back to about an inch of overlap.\n\nThe center of this flange has a small gap to prevent interference from  the inner support bolt/nut.",

        "text": "The flange fabrication has been going really well. The front flange turned out great after trimming, and I decided to continue with the fiberglass flange method for the rear of the plenum. \n\nHere is the front flange after trimming and drilling. I'll need to figure out the best method for screw installation once the prop and starter ring are installed.\n\nThe rear layup was similar to the forward in that I had to split the glass in the middle around the rear support bracket. I also needed to accommodate the part around the oil cooler mount. \n\nI added the peel-ply to absorb extra epoxy.\n\nOnce this cured, I trimmed all the excess and drilled the mounting holes. \n\nI drilled all the holes to 11/64th for -8 screws. Next I will install K1000-8 nutplates to the baffles.",
